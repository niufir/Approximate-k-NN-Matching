# Searching for Element Matches in Large Data Sets
For a large set of data represented by vectors, you need to find a match in a large sample. Those. sweep. It is necessary to analyze algorithms for speed and completeness.
The data in which you need to look for a match has 2 918 139 records,
The size of the marked data (there is a request vector and a response ID) - 100 000 records

Quality metric - aac@5 (the correct answer for the requested vector must be in the top 5 closest)

In this project I am experimenting with various algorithms for finding nearest neighbors
